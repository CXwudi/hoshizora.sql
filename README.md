# hoshizora.sql (CXwudi's fork)

This fork simply added the docker support so that running a dump DB is as simple as running one command.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/CXwudi/hoshizora.sql.git
    ```

2. Download `dump.zip` from [here](https://vocaloid.eu/vocadb/dump.zip), and unzip it to `hoshizora.sql/dump`.

    Your directory structure should look like this:

    ![image](https://s2.loli.net/2023/06/05/V2CzlNHPo4wrsd9.png)

3. Run the following command in `hoshizora.sql/docker` directory:

    ```
    docker compose --profile initializer up -d
    ```

    And wait until both the `vocadump-hoshizora` and `vocadump-importer` containers are exited. Only the `vocadump-mariadb` is running.

    At this point, the DB is ready to be used ðŸ™‚

    To stop the DB, run:

    ```
    docker compose --profile initializer down
    ```

4. Next time when you want to run the dump DB again, simply run the following command in `hoshizora.sql/docker` directory:

    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    To stop, run:

    ```
    docker compose down
    ```

Optionally, you can add `--profile debug` to the above commands to enable the [Adminer](https://hub.docker.com/_/adminer) container, then you can login to Adminer with the user/password/detabase defined in [`.env`](docker/.env) file to checkout the database schema.
